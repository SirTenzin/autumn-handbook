# What is Autumn?

Autumn is the open-source billing infrastructure layer that sits between Stripe and your application. It handles all the complexity of modern SaaS billing so you can focus on building your product, not reinventing billing logic.

Think of Autumn as your billing backend - it manages subscriptions, usage tracking, entitlements, upgrades, downgrades, and everything in between, all through simple API calls.

## Why Autumn?

### The Problem with Traditional Billing

Building billing infrastructure is deceptively complex. What starts as "just integrate Stripe" quickly becomes:
- Managing webhook handlers for dozens of payment events
- Building permission systems tied to subscriptions
- Tracking usage and enforcing limits
- Handling upgrades, downgrades, and prorations
- Creating internal dashboards for customer management
- Dealing with edge cases like failed payments and retry logic

Most companies end up building a tangled mess of billing code spread across their codebase, making it nearly impossible to change pricing without extensive engineering work.

### The Autumn Solution

Autumn provides a complete billing solution through just three simple API calls:
- **Attach** - Handle any purchase flow (new subscriptions, upgrades, downgrades)
- **Check** - Verify access and usage limits in real-time
- **Track** - Record usage events for metered features

Your entire billing logic lives in Autumn, completely decoupled from your application code. Change your pricing anytime without touching your codebase.

## Core Capabilities

### Flexible Pricing Models

Autumn supports any pricing model you can imagine:

- **Subscriptions** - Monthly or annual recurring billing
- **Usage-Based** - Pay for what you use with real-time limits
- **Credit Systems** - Pre-purchase credits that features draw from
- **Seat-Based** - Bill per user with per-seat feature limits
- **Pay Upfront** - Purchase fixed quantities consumed over time
- **Hybrid Models** - Combine any of the above

### Real-Time Entitlements

Know instantly what each customer can access:
- Check feature availability before granting access
- Enforce usage limits in real-time
- Prevent overage or automatically charge for excess usage
- Support complex rules like "10 AI generations per seat per month"

### Complete Customer Management

A full-featured dashboard for your team:
- View and manage all customer subscriptions
- Handle refunds and credits
- Create custom plans for enterprise customers
- Track usage and billing analytics
- Export data for reporting

### Developer-First Design

Built by developers, for developers:
- Simple REST APIs with TypeScript SDKs
- Comprehensive webhook events
- Sandbox environment for testing
- Docker Compose for local development
- Open-source with self-hosting options

## How It Works

### 1. Define Your Products

Create products and plans in the Autumn dashboard:
```javascript
// Example: SaaS with Pro and Enterprise tiers
{
  "product": "Your SaaS",
  "plans": [
    {
      "name": "Pro",
      "price": 29,
      "features": {
        "api_calls": 10000,
        "team_members": 5
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Enterprise",
      "price": 299,
      "features": {
        "api_calls": "unlimited",
        "team_members": "unlimited"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Integrate the APIs

Add Autumn to your application with three simple functions:

```javascript
// Purchase flow - returns Stripe Checkout URL
const checkoutUrl = await autumn.attach({
  customerId: "user_123",
  productId: "pro_plan"
});

// Access control - check before allowing access
const canAccess = await autumn.check({
  customerId: "user_123",
  feature: "api_calls"
});

// Usage tracking - record consumption
await autumn.track({
  customerId: "user_123",
  feature: "api_calls",
  quantity: 1
});
```

### 3. Let Autumn Handle the Rest

Autumn automatically manages:
- Stripe webhook processing
- Subscription lifecycle (trials, renewals, cancellations)
- Payment failures and retry logic
- Proration calculations
- Usage reset cycles
- Invoice generation
- Email notifications
